This folder contains my Unsupervised Learning Course Project

In this Project I used Principal Component Analysis and Clustering Techniques
on the Google Travel Review Dataset on the UCI Machine learning repository linked below:

For this project I completed all required work within a Jupyter notebook using Python and Markdown, so there is no PDF report

I have uploaded the dataset and Jupyter Notebook in this folder
