This folder contains my final report, Jupyter notebook, and dataset for the course Supervised Machine Learning: Regression

The project is based on the Air Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In the project I attempt to build a linear regression model using Polynomial Features, and compare the results using normal OLS Regression vs Regularized Regression via Ridge Regression and LASSO Regression.

For the project I attempt to build a linear model which can predict the PPM measurement of Indium Oxide in the Air.
